                <p class= "bio">Got into the graphic design and large format print industry about 5 years ago and taught myself adobe photoshop and illustrator. In addition to learning the large format print industry I also learned garment silk screen printing and how to do vehicle wraps as well. With the print industry clients, some where looking to get websites created for them and I started to teach myself how to make websites. I fell in love with web development and software engineering and started to search for great content on the web and YouTube and courses from sites like Udemy, fully engulfing myself in learning the industry. That's when I found Lambda and liked the curriculum they offered. I decided to go the boot camp route and haven't regretted it a minute.</p>

                <p class= "bio">Previous to Lambda I worked at BlueCross BlueShield of Minnesota, at that time I was looking to get some experience with insurance as I was planning to apply for PT school. My career trajectory was not going where I wanted so I started looking for a change. I’ve always been interested in computers and coding, my best friend is currently working at a startup in SF and he encouraged me to follow my dream. I did a lot of research online and found Lambda. I’m so grateful for this opportunity and excited for what the future holds!</p>
